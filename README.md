# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree - Landing Page Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the manipulation of the DOM to build a dynamic multi-section landing page. The primary focus is on creating an interactive navigation menu that updates dynamically based on the content of the page. The project showcases how JavaScript can enhance the usability of a static HTML/CSS site by adding dynamic features.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu**: Automatically generated based on the number of sections.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on a navigation item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: The section currently in the viewport is visually highlighted.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the landing page.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout, adhering to SMACSS architecture.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Dynamic DOM manipulation and user interaction.

## Development Strategy

1. **HTML Structure**: Build out the initial structure with multiple sections.
2. **CSS Styling**: Apply styles to make the page visually appealing and responsive.
3. **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**:
   - Create the navigation menu dynamically.
   - Implement smooth scrolling for better user experience.
   - Highlight the active section in the viewport.
4. **Testing and Refactoring**: Ensure the code is clean, efficient, and free of bugs.
